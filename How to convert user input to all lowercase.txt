How to covert user input to all lowercase...

in C# use .ToLower() at the end of user input.


Example...

string answer;
WriteLine("type 'yes' to continue...");
answer = ReadLine().ToLower();

...now even if the user types 'YES' it should be stored as 'yes'.



potential C++ program implementation...

char answerKey;
cout << "Enter 'Y' to continue: ";
cin >> answerKey.ToLower;
